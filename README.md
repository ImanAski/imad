# My journey for learning more (Terminals)

Just note that I'm lifeless and wanted to implement my own emacs(ish) & vim(ish) editor with bidi support. I used so many pieces from [microemacs](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/editors/uemacs/uemacs.git) (I don't know how to write the micro).

## Motivateion

Note that this is a way for me to learn more about c and linux, So please don't use this terminal. Contact me if you would like to let me know things you think it would help me.

### Built with

- C

## Todo
